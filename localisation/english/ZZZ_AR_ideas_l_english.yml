Without them, our skies would be undefended, and our nation could gace devastating strikes by the North or Left-Coast. Therefore, we will sell off some of our fuel reserves and pay out a bonus. We can also use the leftover funds to build state-owned dockyards."

Without them, our coasts and vital shipping lanes would be vulnerable, and we would be strangled by a Northern naval blockade or amphibious invasions. Therefore, we will sell off some of our excess  fuel reserves and pay out a bonus. We can also use the leftover funds to build state-owned factories."
